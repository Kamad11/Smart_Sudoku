<h1>Smart Sudoku</h1>
</div>

An innovative approach to solving the simple sudoku game using artificial intelligence model, image processing, and a basic backtracking algorithm. The visualization of the project is done using a GUI application made with PyQt5. The application has 3 different modes for the user to choose from.

## Three modes to play
### 1. Real-Time mode
Taking the game of sudoku to the next level by using the user's camera and solving the game in real-time. In this mode, the user needs to show an image of the sudoku board, and our AI model will recognize the sudoku board and display the solution by overlaying it on the user's image.

### 2. Upload Image
This is another image processing mode in which the user needs to upload an image of a sudoku board to get its solution.

### 3. Random Generator
This is our interactive mode which randomly generates a unique solvable sudoku board for the user to solve. They can check their solution or get the solution obtained using the backtracking algorithm if they get stuck.

## Installation
`git clone https://github.com/kamad11/Smart_Sudoku`

### Python GUI version
`cd Smart_Sudoku`  
`python mainWindow.py`

### Executable version
Move into **build\exe.win-amd64-3.8** and extract **lib.zip** in the same folder. The **mainWindow.exe** present in the same folder is now ready to be run.
